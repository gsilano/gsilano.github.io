  In my current research, I am focusing on <b>Model Predictive Control (MPC)</b> applied to multi-rotor aerial systems with arbitrarily positioned and
	oriented rotors. The objective is to leverage MPC as a high-performance constrained and predictive control technique in this context.
	Moreover, I am investigating the application of <b>Temporal Logic</b>, specifically Signal Temporal Logic (STL), as a mission specification language for
	path planning problems. STL allows for the incorporation of explicit timing constraints, effectively translating the entire problem into a nonlinear
	non-convex max-min challenge.
  Additionally, I am exploring the exciting field of <b>Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</b>. My research aims to develop systems that assist human
	technicians in hard-to-reach locations, with a particular focus on scenarios involving maintenance and inspection operations.
  Furthermore, the area of <b>communication-aware robotics</b> intrigues me due to its interdisciplinary nature, addressing the challenges of
	maintaining connectivity and robust information flow in robotic networks.
  This scientific research seeks to contribute valuable insights and advancements to the fields of robotics, control systems, and
	human-robot collaboration.</font></p>

	The <b>aim of my research</b> was to illustrate the role and the effectiveness of software-in-the-loop (SIL) methodologies for the analysis
	and control design of flight controllers for small UAV systems. The research proposes a novel SIL methodology to detect and manage instabilities
	of multi-rotor aircraft system that otherwise might not arise when considering only MATLAB/Simulink simulations. The use of the SIL methodology
	allows to understand the behavior of the flight control system by comparing and evaluating different scenarios, with a details level quite close
	to reality thanks to the use of the Gazebo robotics simulator. At the same time, it is possible to discover issues that a model-in-the-loop (MIL)
	simulation does not necessarily detect, even if carried out through a multi-physics co-simulation approach.
