	Currently, I am working on the <b>design and development of algorithms for autonomous systems in 3D simulation environments</b>,
	such as Gazebo, Matlab Virtual Reality (VR) Toolbox, by using detection and tracking algorithms (e.g., Viola-Jones and CAM-Shift,
	respectively) and a properly operating system, i.e., ROS (Robotic Operating System) for analyzing and controlling the behavior of
	small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) systems (aka with the acronym MAV which stands for Micro Aerial Vehicle).

	The control of small UAVs, such as Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 and  Bebop 2.0 (micro-quadcopter) and Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 (nano-quadcopter),
	has been extensively investigated worldwide for functionalities augmentation and costs reduction with respect to a single larger
	vehicle. Software-in-the-loop (SIL) techniques are even more used for detecting and managing instabilities that might be not arise when
    considering only MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Such instabilities may not be just related to the complexity, accuracy or detailed modeling
	of the simulated plant, but rather they may appear due to peculiar features of the final realization and, in particular, the software
	that will implement the control strategy. Indeed, aspects like synchronization, overflow, tasks communication, are all managed by libraries
	or tools available during the control design phase and yet they are specific of the final code implementation. From such perspective, SIL
	simulation has to be considered a valuable tool for discovering, in an earlier phase of the usual V-model process, those issues that a
	model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation does not necessarily detect. At the same time, a SIL simulation, obtained by using realistic and
	detailed simulators, gives the opportunity of validating in an easy way the effects of modifying the control strategy for complex missions.
	That represents quite often the easiest way to tune the flight control system and to check its validity.

	The aim of this research is to propose a co-design approach based on software-in-the-loop methodologies for performance evaluation, designing
	and developing algorithms for autonomous systems. The simulation scheme consists of specific middleware, namely ROS, where one node or computer
	simulates the control unit (e.g., MATLAB/Simulink equipped with Robotics System Toolbox), and another one the vehicles in the scenario
	(sensor models and obstacles are simulated, too), through 3D simulation environments (e.g., Gazebo, V-REP, AirSim, MORSE, Webots), with the aim
	of implementing the overall control system together with the flight dynamics and the environment.
