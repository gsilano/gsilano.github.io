	The content and design of this site was based from on an earlier version of <a href="https://www.alex-winkler.com/"><b>Alexander W. Winkler's</b></a> website.

	When I decided to build my website (I thought it was a good idea to get to know myself and my work known on the web), I was looking for something easy to manage and
	update. Something that was modern and that could help me to publish in a rapid way all my papers and new infos about my research and career. While considering websites
	of my colleagues abroad, (e.g., <a href="https://www.alex-winkler.com/"><b>Alexander W. Winkler</b></a>, <a href="http://jpreiss.github.io/"><b>James Alan
	Preiss</b></a>), I discovered static site generators, in particular <a href="http://jemdoc.jaboc.net/"><b>jemdoc</b></a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><b>Jekyll
	</b></a>.

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">

	I realized the benefits of a static site:
	</font></p>

	<ul class="lead">
	  <font size="-0.5">
		<li>provide improved security over dynamic websites;</li><p />
		<li>improve performance for end users compared to dynamic websites;</li> <p />
		<li>ensure fewer or no dependencies on systems such as databases or other application servers;</li> <p />
		<li>allow cost savings from utilizing cloud storage, as opposed to a hosted environment.</li> <p />
	  </font>
	</ul>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">
	<font size="-0.5">
	Looking around websites using such technologies, I saw <a href="https://www.alex-winkler.com/"><b>Alexander W. Winkler's site</b></a> and I really enjoyed his style.
	Therefore, I contacted Alexander expressing my appreciation and asked him to use its earlier style for my website using Jekyll.

	<h2>The Mechanics</h2>

	<p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">
	<font size="-0.5">
	Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language (e.g., TeX or Markdown) and it churns through layouts
	to createa static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

	<br><br>
	To learn the basics of using Jekyll - Static Site Generator, I followed the online course of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw"><b>Mike Dane</b></a>,
	available at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB"><b>link</b></a>. The course teaches you everything you need to know
	to create a professional and scalable website or blog!
