				<a target="_blank" href="https://aerial-core.eu/"><b>Aerial-Core</b></a> is an ICT project. It aims to develop core technology
				modules and an integrated aerial cognitive robotic system that will have unprecedented capabilities on the operational range and safety
				in the interaction with people, or Aerial Co-Workers (ACW) for applications such as the inspection and maintenance of large linear
				infrastructures. The system will integrate aerial robots with different characteristics and will be able to meet the requirements of:
				(1) Long range (Several kilometres) and local very accurate (subcentimetre) inspection of the infrastructure, (2) maintenance activities
				based on aerial manipulation involving force interactions, and (3) aerial co-working safely and efficiently helping human workers in
				inspection and maintenance. Within the project, <b>my role</b> was that of leader from CTU side.

				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.comp4drones.eu/"><b>Comp4Drones</b></a> is an ECSEL JU project with the aim of providing a framework of key enabling
				technologies for safe and autonomous drones. It brings to bear a holistically designed ecosystem from application to electronic components, realized as a
				tightly integrated multi-vendor and compositional UAV embedded architecture solution and a tool chain complementing the compositional architecture principles.
				The ecosystem aims at supporting (1) efficient customization and incremental assurance of drone embedded platforms, (2) safe autonomous decision making concerning
				individual or cooperative missions, (3) trustworthy drone-to-drone and drone-to-ground communications even in presence of malicious attackers and under the
				intrinsic platform constraints, and (4) agile and cost-effective compositional design and assurance of drone modules and systems. Within the project,
				<b>my role</b> was that of participant.

				The <a target="_blank" href="https://mbzirc.com/"><b>Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotic Challenge</b></a> (<b>MBZIRC</b>) is a biennial international
				robotics competition that provides an ambitious and technologically demanding set of challenges and is open to all teams from all countries. Also, the MBZIRC
				competition aims to inspire future robotics through innovative solutions and technological excellence. Within the competition, specifically the “challenge 2”,
				autonomous aerial and ground robots have been carried out for navigation and manipulation tasks, in unstructured, outdoor and indoor environments. In particular,
				a team of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) collaborating to autonomously locate, pick, transport and assemble different types
				of brick shaped objects to build pre-defined structures, in an outdoor environment. Those challenge is motivated by construction automation and autonomous robot
				based 3D printing of large structures. Within the competition, <b>my role</b> was that of participant. More information about the challenges, the partecipants
				and the achivied results can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://mbzirc2020team.laas.fr/"><b>http://mbzirc2020team.laas.fr/</b></a>.

				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.afarcloud.eu/"><b>AFarCloud</b></a> is an ECSEL JU project with the aim of providing a distributed platform for autonomous
				farming that will allow the integration and cooperation of agriculture Cyber Physical Systems in real-time in order to increase efficiency, productivity, animal health,
				food quality and reduce farm labour costs. This platform will be integrated with farm management software and will support monitoring and decision-making solutions based
				on big data and real time data mining techniques. The AFarCloud project also aims to make farming robots accessible to more users by enabling farming vehicles to work in
				a cooperative mesh, thus opening up new applications and ensuring re-usability, as heterogeneous standard vehicles can combine their capabilities in order to lift farmer
				revenue and reduce labour costs. Within the project, <b>my role</b> was that of participant.
