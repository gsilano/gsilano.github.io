	I was born in Benevento, Italy, in 1989. I received the bachelor’s degree in computer engineering (2012), the master’s degree in electronic
	engineering (2016), and the doctorate in information engineering (2020) from the <a href="https://www.unisannio.it/it"><b>University of Sannio</b></a>,
	Benevento, Italy. From May to November 2016, I joined the automatic control group (GRACE) as a research fellow at the same university. During my
	doctorate, I worked on the use of software-in-the-loop methodologies for the analysis and control design of small UAV systems, under the supervision
	of <a href="http://home.ing.unisannio.it/iannelli/cv/" rel="_blank"><b>Prof. Dr. Luigi Iannelli</b></a>. From March to November 2019, I was a
	visiting Ph.D. student at LAAS - CNRS, in Toulouse, working with <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/afranchi/robotics/?q=node/1"><b>Prof. Dr.
	Antonio Franchi</b></a> and his team. From June 2020 to July 2022, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at the Czech Technical University in Prague,
	working with the <a href="http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/"><b>Multi-robot System (MRS) Group</b></a> together with <a href="http://mrs.felk.cvut.cz/people/martin-saska"
	rel="_blank"><b>Prof. Dr. Martin Saska</b></a>. Currently, I'm a research fellow at <a href="https://www.rse-web.it/"><b>Ricerica sul Sistema Energetico (RSE) S.p.A.</b></a>
	with the Department of Generation Technologies and Materials. Since 2022 I serve as associate editor for <a href="https://icuas.com/" rel="_blank"><b>International
	Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)</b></a>. My research interests are in simulation, control and motion planning problems for unmanned aerial
	vehicles, autonomous systems, model predictive control techniques, optimization problems, and robot manipulators. </font></p>
