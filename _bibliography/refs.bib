The approach aims to monitor the safety of human workers, especially those working at heights. In the proposed scheme, one UAV acts as the leader of the formation and is equipped with sensors for human worker detection and gesture recognition. The follower UAVs maintain a predetermined formation relative to the worker’s position, thereby providing additional perspectives of the monitored scene. The use of hand gestures allows the human worker to specify movements and action commands for the UAV team, without the need for an additional communication channel or specific markers including the relative distance. Field experiments with three UAVs and a human worker in a mock-up scenario showcase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the proposed approach.},

The MRS Drone features unique modularity with respect to changes in actuators, frames, and sensory configuration. As the name suggests, the platform is specially tailored for deployment within a MRS group. The MRS Drone contributes to the state-of-the-art of UAV platforms by allowing smooth real-world deployment of multiple aerial robots, as well as by outperforming other platforms with its modularity. For real-world multi-robot deployment in various applications, the platform is easy to both assemble and modify. Moreover, it is accompanied by a realistic simulator to enable safe pre-flight testing and a smooth transition to complex real-world experiments. In this manuscript, we present mechancal and electrical designs, software architecture, and technical specifications to build a fully autonomous multi UAV system. Finally, we demonstrate the full capabilities and the unique modularity of the MRS Drone in various real-world applications that required a diverse range of platform configurations.}

 abstract     = {This article proposes Persistence Administered Collective Navigation (PACNav) as an approach for achieving decentralized collective navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms. The technique is based on the flocking and collective navigation behavior observed in natural swarms, such as cattle herds, bird flocks, and even large groups of humans. As global and concurrent information of all swarm members is not available in natural swarms, these systems use local observations to achieve the desired behavior. Similarly, PACNav relies only on local observations of relative positions of UAVs, making it suitable for large swarms deprived of communication capabilities and external localization systems. We introduce the novel concepts of path persistence and path similarity that allow each swarm member to analyze the motion of other members in order to determine its own future motion. PACNav is based on two main principles: (1) UAVs with little variation in motion direction have high path persistence, and are considered by other UAVs to be reliable leaders; (2) groups of UAVs that move in a similar direction have high path similarity, and such groups are assumed to contain a reliable leader. The proposed approach also embeds a reactive collision avoidance mechanism to avoid collisions with swarm members and environmental obstacles. This collision avoidance ensures safety while reducing deviations from the assigned path. Along with several simulated experiments, we present a real-world experiment in a natural forest, showcasing the validity and effectiveness of the proposed collective navigation approach in challenging environments. The source code is released as open-source, making it possible to replicate the obtained results and facilitate the continuation of research by the community.}

 abstract     = {Multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although originally designed and developed for defence and military purposes, in the last ten years have gained momentum, especially for civilian applications, such as search and rescue, surveying and mapping, and agricultural crops and monitoring. Thanks to their hovering and Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities and the capacity to carry out tasks with complete autonomy, they are now a standard platform for both research and industrial uses. However, while the flight control architecture is well established in the literature, there are still many challenges in designing autonomous guidance and navigation systems to make the UAV able to work in constrained and cluttered environments or also indoors. Therefore, the main motivation of this work is to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive literature review on the numerous methods and approaches to address path-planning problems for multi-rotor UAVs. In particular, the inclusion of a review of the related research in the context of Precision Agriculture (PA) provides a unified and accessible presentation for researchers who are initiating their endeavours in this subject.}

 abstract    = {Multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) need to tilt in order to move; this modifies the UAV's antenna orientation. We consider the scenario where a multi-rotor UAV serves as a communication relay between a Base Station (BS) and another UAV. We propose a framework to generate feasible trajectories for the multi-rotor UAV relay while considering its motion dynamics and the motion-induced changes of the antenna orientation. The UAV relay’s trajectory is optimized to maximize the end-to-end number of bits transmitted. Numerical simulations in MATLAB and Gazebo show the benefits of accounting for the antenna orientation variations due to the UAV tilt.}

The platform is based on Matlab and the MathWorks Virtual Reality (VR) and Computer Vision System (CVS) toolboxes that work together to simulate the behavior of a quad-rotor while tracking a car that moves along a nontrivial path. The VR toolbox has been chosen due to the familiarity that students have with Matlab and because it does not require a notable effort by the user for the learning and development phase thanks to its simple structure.

 abstract    = {Aerial robotics is a fast-growing field of robotics and in particular multirotor aircraft, like quad-rotors, are rapidly increasing in popularity also out of the scientific community. Thanks to their hovering and Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities and the capacity to perform tasks with complete autonomy, they are now a standard platform for numerous military and civilian applications, e.g., inspections of power lines, bridges and pipelines, soil and field analysis, crop monitoring. Among different advantages offered by such class of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), there is the capacity to perform tasks with complete autonomy thus minimizing costs and risks involved with the direct intervention of human operators. However, designing autopilots for UAVs is a challenging task, which involves multiple interconnected aspects. Numerous researchers are currently addressing the problem of designing autonomous guidance and navigation systems as well as control systems for multi-rotor vehicles. Therefore, having tools able to show what it happens when some new applications are going to be developed in unknown or critical situations is more and more important. Simulation is one of such helpful tools, widely used in robotics, enabling not only to verify the components integration and to evaluate their behavior under different circumstances but also to simplify the development and validation processes. Furthermore, simulation is cheaper than experiments with real robots, in terms of time and human resources. It can also provide more flexibility, by allowing testing under conditions that would be unfeasible otherwise: a simulated environment can be significantly more complex and larger than a lab environment, and meanwhile ensure a perfect repeatability. Moreover, it makes possible simulating multiple robots when the hardware may not be available. Finally, bugs and mistakes in simulation cost virtually nothing: it is possible to crash a vehicle several times and thereby getting a better understanding of implemented methods under various conditions. Different solutions, typically based on dedicated robotic simulators such as Gazebo, V-REP, AirSim, MORSE, are available to this purpose. They employ recent advances in computation and computer graphics in order to simulate physical phenomena (gravity, magnetism, atmospheric conditions) and perception (e.g., providing sensor models) in such a way that the environment realistically reflects the actual world. Definitely, it comes out that software platforms able to test algorithms for UAVs moving in a simulated 3D environment are becoming an indispensable part of the design phase. The aim of this thesis is to show the role and the effectiveness of robotics simulators in flight control system design for multi-rotor aircraft (especially, quad-rotors) proposing a Software-in-the-loop (SIL) methodology. In particular it will be explained, by using rather complex examples, how a SIL approach allows to detect and to manage instabilities that otherwise might not arise when considering only MATLAB/Simulink simulations. On the other hand such instabilities may not be just related to the complexity, accuracy or detailed modeling of the simulated plant, but rather they may appear due to peculiar features of the final realization and, in particular, the software that will implement the control strategy. Indeed, aspects like synchronization, overflow, tasks communication, are all managed by libraries or tools available during the control design phase and yet they are specific of the final code implementation. From such perspective, SIL simulation has to be considered a valuable tool for discovering, in an earlier phase of the usual V-model process, those issues that Model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation does not necessarily detect. At the same time, a SIL simulation, obtained by using realistic and detailed simulators, gives the opportunity of validating in an easy way the effects of modifying the control strategy for complex missions. That represents quite often the easiest way to tune the flight control system and to check its validity. Although advantages of such methodology are reasonable for the scientific community from a very general viewpoint, illustrative case studies can be of interest in particular if declined to the specific application, and when the code is provided as open-source for scientific and educational. activities. Thus, the thesis aims to give the reader practical and concrete evidence of the above considerations by looking at an up-to-date control application, i.e., the flight control system of small quad-rotors and rather complex platforms, providing a complete SIL simulation methodology.}

We make use of a novel paradigm for physical interaction in aerial robotics called "The Flying End-Effector" and integrate it with a hybrid visual servoing scheme. The proposed control architecture allows a fully actuated aerial robot to be visually driven to a goal using an on-board camera while achieving bounded force exchange with the environment without the need for a force/torque sensor. The hybrid visual servoing scheme is integrated with an admittance filter, while a wrench observer is used to get an estimate for the interaction wrench. We intend to make use of this control architecture for pick and place operations within the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Competition (MBZIRC). In particular, the proposed framework will be used to build a wall composed by different bricks. The overall control scheme is validated experimentally on a picking task. The experiments show the viability of the proposed control architecture and provide insights on the present limitations.}
